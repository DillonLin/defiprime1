Grass provides you with an opportunity to earn passive income by selling your unused bandwidth, while maintaining your privacy. Verified companies can use your idle bandwidth without accessing any of your personal information. All buyers are carefully examined and supervised to prevent any misuse or illegal activities. With Grass, only up to 0.3% of your bandwidth is utilized at any given time, and it does not affect your internet speed as it functions only when you are not using your full bandwidth.
