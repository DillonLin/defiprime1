DeFiprime.com is a media outlet and analytical services provider for the DeFi community. Its mandate is to inform, educate, and connect the community as the definitive source of news dedicated to decentralized finance space.

### Product Listing 101: definition of "the best DeFi Product"

We are a _curated list_ of DeFi products, not aiming to list every existing product, but only the best ones. The product listing could be a _subjective_ process, and not a substitute for professional advice and independent verification.

- Is this a product interesting to the people outside of its own bagholders community?
- Is it a live product functioning on mainnet(not coming soon, not testnet, not "please take a look at our whitepaper")?
- Visible product traction(not empty marketplace, not empty order book, etc).
- Decentralized or open-sourced frontend in case you want to play with geofences. Label 'Region is not supported' is a spit in the face of DeFi. Check our recent [twitter-poll](https://twitter.com/defiprime/status/1130890433821724672) with community sentiment on this matter.
- No crypto tribalism and bias. Ethereum, Tron, EOS, Bitcoin and the rest of blockchains are equal as long as a DeFi product built on top of it is useful.
- Lastly: no, you can’t buy a listing on Defiprime, don’t waste your time.

So to reiterate, we’ll give you two examples below.

**Bad pitch** for listing at DeFiprime:

- "We are going to change the world with our super-duper AI-based smart contract platform, here is our whitepaper. We have 50,000 people at our Telegram group! We also struck a deal of the century with a big brand(but no one has heard about this brand anyway, and it's not related to Finance or Blockchain). Still working on our product launch, but you can play with this thing on testnet."

**Good pitch** for listing at DeFiprime:

- "We launched on mainnet three months ago, after two respectable auditors independently audited our smart contracts. Since our launch, we achieved this and that milestones, and XXXX users using our app regularly. We also integrated with a few well known DeFi protocols."
